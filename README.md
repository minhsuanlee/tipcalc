# tipcalc
Calculates the tip on a dinner at a nice restaurant
## Basics
 - Runs on IceCreamSandwich or later versions of API
 - There is a text edit (labeled “Amount”) allowing the users to enter the service charge, and a pushbutton labeled “Tip”.
 - Only numbers will be allowed in the service charge textedit.
 - Reads like a USD currency amount (“$15.23”).
As a user, when I enter data into the service charge textedit, it should enable the “Tip” pushbutton.
 - When the “Tip” pushbutton is pushed, it calculates the tip (15% of the value in the service charge textedit) and display that value in a Toast message. The value would be displayed as USD currency (“$15.23”).
